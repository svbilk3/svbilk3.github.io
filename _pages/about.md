<h1>StarkNet</h1> is a permissionless decentralized rollup optimized for scalability, security and simplicity. It is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to help Ethereum scale while leveraging its security.

StarkNet uses ZK-STARK technology to generate zero-knowledge proofs that validate transactions off-chain. This allows it to significantly improve on transaction throughput and cost compared to transacting directly on Ethereum mainnet.

Some key features of StarkNet:

**Near-linear scalability** - it can process thousands of transactions per second with low fees.

**EVM compatibility** - it supports all smart contracts and dApps that work on Ethereum.

**Decentralized security** - leverages Ethereum as the consensus and security layer.

**Transparent validity proofs** - ZK-STARKs allow users to verify transaction validity without revealing contents.

**Developer friendly** - writing Cairo smart contracts is similar to existing languages like Solidity.

StarkNet aims to make decentralized apps more accessible to mainstream users by providing an Ethereum L2 solution focused on performance, ease of use and maintaining decentralization. It's currently in public alpha stage.
